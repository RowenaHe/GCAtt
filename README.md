# GCAtt: Large-Models-are-Good-Annotators-for-Zero-Shot-Learning

This repository is for the data and code used for our SIGIR25 paper "Large Models are Good Annotators for Zero-Shot Learning".

Download the res101.hdf5 files (2048-dim vectors extracted with a pre-trained ResNet101) from xian2017 projects and put them under the data file. Name the files as AWA2_res101.hdf5, CUB_res101.hdf5, FLO_res101.hdf5, SUN_res101.hdf5, respectively. 

The re-implemented ZSL methods are based on f-CLSWGAN, CADA-VAE, SJE, and SDGZSL projects. These are some well-known and well-performing ZSL methods. Please see their papers and public projects for more details.
